# Pewlett-Hackard_Analysis
Analysis of HR data utilizing Postgres and pgAdmin


## Overview of Pewlett-Hackard Analysis
The purpose of this project is to utilize Postgres and pgAdmin to update Pewlett-Hackard's (PH) HR data environment into a SQL database from previously maintained Excel files.   An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was used to create and document the new database as seen below.  After which, SQL queries were developed to pull some critical employee data PH is needing; employees reaching retirement by title and eligible employees to participate in a mentorship program.  The final analysis of the data provides impacts from the high volumes of soon-to-be retirees.

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
